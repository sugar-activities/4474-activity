# The algorithm used to assign a new book in an existing series a series number.
# New series numbers assigned using this tweak are always integer values, except
# if a constant non-integer is specified.
# Possible values are:
# next - First available integer larger than the largest existing number
# first_free - First available integer larger than 0
# next_free - First available integer larger than the smallest existing number
# last_free - First available integer smaller than the largest existing number
#             Return largest existing + 1 if no free number is found
# const - Assign the number 1 always
# a number - Assign that number always. The number is not in quotes. Note that
#            0.0 can be used here.
# Examples:
# series_index_auto_increment = 'next'
# series_index_auto_increment = 'next_free'
# series_index_auto_increment = 16.5
series_index_auto_increment = 'next'


# The algorithm used to copy author to author_sort
# Possible values are:
#  invert: use "fn ln" -> "ln, fn" (the original algorithm)
#  copy  : copy author to author_sort without modification
#  comma : use 'copy' if there is a ',' in the name, otherwise use 'invert'
#  nocomma : "fn ln" -> "ln fn" (without the comma)
# When this tweak is changed, the author_sort values stored with each author
# must be recomputed by right-clicking on an author in the left-hand tags pane,
# selecting 'manage authors', and pressing 'Recalculate all author sort values'.
author_sort_copy_method = 'invert'


# Set whether boolean custom columns are two- or three-valued.
#  Two-values for true booleans
#  three-values for yes/no/unknown
# Set to 'yes' for three-values, 'no' for two-values
bool_custom_columns_are_tristate = 'yes'


# Provide a set of columns to be sorted on when calibre starts
#  The argument is None if saved sort history is to be used
#  otherwise it is a list of column,order pairs. Column is the
#  lookup/search name, found using the tooltip for the column
#  Order is 0 for ascending, 1 for descending
# For example, set it to [('authors',0),('title',0)] to sort by
# title within authors.
sort_columns_at_startup = None

# Format to be used for publication date and the timestamp (date).
#  A string controlling how the publication date is displayed in the GUI
#  d    the day as number without a leading zero (1 to 31)
#  dd    the day as number with a leading zero (01 to 31)
#  ddd    the abbreviated localized day name (e.g. 'Mon' to 'Sun').
#  dddd    the long localized day name (e.g. 'Monday' to 'Qt::Sunday').
#  M    the month as number without a leading zero (1-12)
#  MM    the month as number with a leading zero (01-12)
#  MMM    the abbreviated localized month name (e.g. 'Jan' to 'Dec').
#  MMMM    the long localized month name (e.g. 'January' to 'December').
#  yy    the year as two digit number (00-99)
#  yyyy    the year as four digit number
#  For example, given the date of 9 Jan 2010, the following formats show
#  MMM yyyy ==> Jan 2010    yyyy ==> 2010       dd MMM yyyy ==> 09 Jan 2010
#  MM/yyyy ==> 01/2010      d/M/yy ==> 9/1/10   yy ==> 10
# publication default if not set: MMM yyyy
# timestamp default if not set: dd MMM yyyy

# Control title and series sorting in the library view.
# If set to 'library_order', Leading articles such as The and A will be ignored.
# If set to 'strictly_alphabetic', the titles will be sorted without processing
# For example, with library_order, The Client will sort under 'C'. With
# strictly_alphabetic, the book will sort under 'T'.
# This flag affects Calibre's library display. It has no effect on devices. In
# addition, titles for books added before changing the flag will retain their
# order until the title is edited. Double-clicking on a title and hitting return
# without changing anything is sufficient to change the sort.
title_series_sorting = 'library_order'

# Control how title and series names are formatted when saving to disk/sending
# to device. If set to library_order, leading articles such as The and A will
# be put at the end
# If set to 'strictly_alphabetic', the titles will be sorted without processing
# For example, with library_order, "The Client" will become "Client, The". With
# strictly_alphabetic, it would remain "The Client".
save_template_title_series_sorting = 'library_order'

# Set the list of words that are to be considered 'articles' when computing the
# title sort strings. The list is a regular expression, with the articles
# separated by 'or' bars. Comparisons are case insensitive, and that cannot be
# changed. Changes to this tweak won't have an effect until the book is modified
# in some way. If you enter an invalid pattern, it is silently ignored.
# To disable use the expression: '^$'
# Default: '^(A|The|An)\s+'
title_sort_articles=r'^(A|The|An)\s+'


# Specify a folder that calibre should connect to at startup using
# connect_to_folder. This must be a full path to the folder. If the folder does
# not exist when calibre starts, it is ignored. If there are '\' characters in
# the path (such as in Windows paths), you must double them.
# Examples:
#     auto_connect_to_folder = 'C:\\Users\\someone\\Desktop\\testlib'
#     auto_connect_to_folder = '/home/dropbox/My Dropbox/someone/library'
auto_connect_to_folder = ''


# Specify renaming rules for sony collections. This tweak is only applicable if
# metadata management is set to automatic. Collections on Sonys are named
# depending upon whether the field is standard or custom. A collection derived
# from a standard field is named for the value in that field. For example, if
# the standard 'series' column contains the name 'Darkover', then the series
# will be named 'Darkover'. A collection derived from a custom field will have
# the name of the field added to the value. For example, if a custom series
# column named 'My Series' contains the name 'Darkover', then the collection
# will be named 'Darkover (My Series)'. If two books have fields that generate
# the same collection name, then both books will be in that collection. This
# tweak lets you specify for a standard or custom field the value to be put
# inside the parentheses. You can use it to add a parenthetical description to a
# standard field, for example 'Foo (Tag)' instead of the 'Foo'. You can also use
# it to force multiple fields to end up in the same collection. For example, you
# could force the values in 'series', '#my_series_1', and '#my_series_2' to
# appear in collections named 'some_value (Series)', thereby merging all of the
# fields into one set of collections. The syntax of this tweak is
# {'field_lookup_name':'name_to_use', 'lookup_name':'name', ...}
# Example 1: I want three series columns to be merged into one set of
# collections. If the column lookup names are 'series', '#series_1' and
# '#series_2', and if I want nothing in the parenthesis, then the value to use
# in the tweak value would be:
# sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'', '#series_1':'', '#series_2':''}
# Example 2: I want the word '(Series)' to appear on collections made from
# series, and the word '(Tag)' to appear on collections made from tags. Use:
# sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', 'tags':'Tag'}
# Example 3: I want 'series' and '#myseries' to be merged, and for the
# collection name to have '(Series)' appended. The renaming rule is:
# sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', '#myseries':'Series'}
sony_collection_renaming_rules={}


# Specify how sony collections are sorted. This tweak is only applicable if
# metadata management is set to automatic. You can indicate which metadata is to
# be used to sort on a collection-by-collection basis. The format of the tweak
# is a list of metadata fields from which collections are made, followed by the
# name of the metadata field containing the sort value.
# Example: The following indicates that collections built from pubdate and tags
# are to be sorted by the value in the custom column '#mydate', that collections
# built from 'series' are to be sorted by 'series_index', and that all other
# collections are to be sorted by title. If a collection metadata field is not
# named, then if it is a series- based collection it is sorted by series order,
# otherwise it is sorted by title order.
# [(['pubdate', 'tags'],'#mydate'), (['series'],'series_index'), (['*'], 'title')]
# Note that the bracketing and parentheses are required. The syntax is
# [ ( [list of fields], sort field ) , ( [ list of fields ] , sort field ) ]
# Default: empty (no rules), so no collection attributes are named.
sony_collection_sorting_rules = []


# Create search terms to apply a query across several built-in search terms.
# Syntax: {'new term':['existing term 1', 'term 2', ...], 'new':['old'...] ...}
# Example: create the term 'myseries' that when used as myseries:foo would
# search all of the search categories 'series', '#myseries', and '#myseries2':
# grouped_search_terms={'myseries':['series','#myseries', '#myseries2']}
# Example: two search terms 'a' and 'b' both that search 'tags' and '#mytags':
# grouped_search_terms={'a':['tags','#mytags'], 'b':['tags','#mytags']}
# Note: You cannot create a search term that is a duplicate of an existing term.
# Such duplicates will be silently ignored. Also note that search terms ignore
# case. 'MySearch' and 'mysearch' are the same term.

# content_server_will_display is a list of custom fields to be displayed.
# content_server_wont_display is a list of custom fields not to be displayed.
# wont_display has priority over will_display.
# The special value '*' means all custom fields. The value [] means no entries.
# Defaults:
#    content_server_will_display = ['*']
#    content_server_wont_display = []
# Examples:
# To display only the custom fields #mytags and #genre:
#   content_server_will_display = ['#mytags', '#genre']
#   content_server_wont_display = []
# To display all fields except #mycomments:
#   content_server_will_display = ['*']
#   content_server_wont_display['#mycomments']

# Set the maximum number of sort 'levels' that calibre will use to resort the
# library after certain operations such as searches or device insertion. Each

# level sorts, and if you are seeing a slowdown, reduce the value of this tweak.

# Language to use when sorting. Setting this tweak will force sorting to use the
# collating order for the specified language. This might be useful if you run
# calibre in English but want sorting to work in the language where you live.
# Set the tweak to the desired ISO 639-1 language code, in lower case.
# You can find the list of supported locales at
# http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/topic/nls/rbagsicusortsequencetables.htm
